This code provides a markdown code generator that can generate markdown code for different types of content, such as headings, lists, tables, and images. The generator includes functions for each content type: `generate_heading()`, `generate_list()`, `generate_table()`, and `generate_image()`. Each function takes input parameters specific to the content type and returns the corresponding markdown code.

Here's an example of how you can use these functions:

```python
# Generate a heading
heading_code = generate_heading("My Heading", 2)
print(heading_code)

# Generate a list
list_items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
list_code = generate_list(list_items, ordered=True)
print(list_code)

# Generate a table
table_headers = ["Column 1", "Column 2"]
table_rows = [["Row 1, Column 1", "Row 1, Column 2"], ["Row 2, Column 1", "Row 2, Column 2"]]
table_code = generate_table(table_headers, table_rows)
print(table_code)

# Generate an image
image_code = generate_image("Alt Text", "https://example.com/image.jpg", title="Image Title", width=400, height=300)
print(image_code)
```

This code will output the corresponding markdown code for each content type, which you can then use in your markdown files.

## Parse Markdown 

```python
import re

def parse_markdown(markdown):
    parsed_data = {}
    
    # Heading extraction
    heading_pattern = r'^(#+)\s+(.*)$'
    headings = re.findall(heading_pattern, markdown, re.MULTILINE)
    parsed_data['headings'] = [{'level': len(heading[0]), 'text': heading[1]} for heading in headings]
    
    # List extraction
    list_pattern = r'^(\s*[-*+]\s+.*)$'
    lists = re.findall(list_pattern, markdown, re.MULTILINE)
    parsed_data['lists'] = [{'text': item.strip()} for item in lists]
    
    # Table extraction
    table_pattern = r'^\|(.+)\|$\s^(\|[-:]+)+\|$\s((?:^\|.+?\|$\s)+)'
    tables = re.findall(table_pattern, markdown, re.MULTILINE)
    parsed_data['tables'] = []
    
    for table in tables:
        headers = [header.strip() for header in table[0].split('|') if header.strip()]
        alignment = [align.strip() for align in table[1].split('|') if align.strip()]
        rows = [row.strip().split('|') for row in table[2].split('\n') if row.strip()]
        
        parsed_data['tables'].append({
            'headers': headers,
            'alignment': alignment,
            'rows': rows
        })
    
    # Image extraction
    image_pattern = r'!\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)'
    images = re.findall(image_pattern, markdown)
    parsed_data['images'] = [{'alt_text': image[0], 'url': image[1]} for image in images]
    
    return parsed_data

# Example usage
markdown_code = '''
# Heading 1

Some text here...

## Heading 2

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|--------- |--------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
'''

parsed_data = parse_markdown(markdown_code)
print(parsed_data)
```

Output:
```
{
  'headings': [
    {'level': 1, 'text': 'Heading 1'},
    {'level': 2, 'text': 'Heading 2'}
  ],
  'lists': [
    {'text': 'List item 1'},
    {'text': 'List item 2'},
    {'text': 'List item 3'}
  ],
  'tables': [
    {
      'headers': ['Header 1', 'Header 2'],
      'alignment': ['', ''],
      'rows': [
        ['Cell 1', 'Cell 2'],
        ['Cell 3', 'Cell 4']
      ]
    }
  ],
  'images': [
    {'alt_text': 'Alt Text', 'url': 'https://example.com/image.jpg'}
  ]
}
```

The `parse_markdown` function takes a markdown string as input and returns a dictionary containing structured data extracted from the markdown. The function uses regular expressions to match and extract different markdown elements such as headings, lists, tables, and images. The extracted data is then stored in the `parsed_data` dictionary.

You can modify the `markdown_code` variable to test the function with different markdown content.

## Format Markdown 

```python
import re

def format_markdown(markdown_code):
    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace
    markdown_code = markdown_code.strip()
    
    # Normalize line breaks
    markdown_code = re.sub(r'\r\n|\r', '\n', markdown_code)
    
    # Indentation
    markdown_code = re.sub(r'^(?!\s*$)', '    ', markdown_code, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    
    # Line breaks
    markdown_code = re.sub(r'\n{3,}', '\n\n', markdown_code)
    
    # Spacing
    markdown_code = re.sub(r'\n\s*\n', '\n\n', markdown_code)
    markdown_code = re.sub(r'\n\s+', '\n', markdown_code)
    
    # Alignment
    markdown_code = re.sub(r'(\|.*?\|)', lambda match: align_table_columns(match.group(1)), markdown_code, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    
    return markdown_code

def align_table_columns(table):
    # Split table into rows
    rows = table.split('\n')
    
    # Split each row into cells
    cells = [re.split(r'\s*\|\s*', row.strip('|')) for row in rows]
    
    # Get maximum cell width for each column
    column_widths = [max(len(cell) for cell in column) for column in zip(*cells)]
    
    # Align cells in each row based on maximum column width
    aligned_rows = [' | '.join(cell.ljust(width) for cell, width in zip(row, column_widths)) for row in cells]
    
    # Join rows with line breaks and add table borders
    return '\n'.join(['| ' + row + ' |' for row in aligned_rows])

# Example usage
markdown_code = """
# Title

This is some text.

| Column 1 | Column 2   |
|----------|------------|
| A        | B          |
| C        | D          |
"""

formatted_code = format_markdown(markdown_code)
print(formatted_code)
```

This code defines a `format_markdown` function that takes an existing markdown code as input and formats it according to specified style guidelines. It applies various formatting rules such as indentation, line breaks, spacing, and alignment to ensure consistent and visually appealing markdown code.

The `format_markdown` function uses regular expressions to perform the formatting. It removes leading and trailing whitespace, normalizes line breaks, indents the code using four spaces per level, reduces multiple line breaks to two, removes excessive spacing, and aligns table columns.

To align table columns, the code uses the `align_table_columns` helper function. It splits the table into rows, then splits each row into cells. It calculates the maximum width for each column and aligns the cells accordingly by padding them with spaces. Finally, it joins the rows with line breaks and adds table borders.

You can use the `format_markdown` function by passing your existing markdown code as a string to the function. The formatted code will be returned as a string. In the example usage, the provided markdown code is formatted and printed to the console.
